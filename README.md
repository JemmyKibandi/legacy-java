 Java Tests on Replit  

This repository contains simple Java console applications, including programs like a To-Do List App, Number Sum Calculator, and more.  

 🔹 Running Java Code on Replit  

To run Java programs on [Replit](https://replit.com/~), follow these steps:  

 1️⃣ Open Replit & Create a New Java Project  
- Go to [Replit Java](https://replit.com/languages/java)  
- Click "Create" and choose Java as the language.  

 2️⃣ Ensure the Main Method is Named `main`  
- Replit expects the main method to be named `main` inside `Main.java`  
- If your code has a different method name, change it to:  

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Your Java code here
  }
  ```

 3️⃣ Check File Name (`Main.java`)  
- The main class must be inside `Main.java` in Replit.  
- If you copy code from another source, make sure the filename and class match.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  public class Main {  // Class name must match Main.java
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, Java on Replit!");
      }
  }
  ```

 4️⃣ Run the Code  
- Click the "Run" button at the top of Replit.  
- If there's an error, check that:  
  - The method name is `main`.  
  - The file name is `Main.java`.
